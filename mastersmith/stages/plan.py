PLAN_PROMPT = """You are the builder of a game-ready 3D asset. It will be modelled as SEPARATE PARTS and assembled, so that
every edge is crisp: nothing is sculpted as one blob.

The asset: {description}
Category: {category}. Real length {length_m:.3f} m (height {height_m:.3f} m, width {width_m:.3f} m).

Picture 1 is the SIDE view, cropped exactly to the object: the forward end (muzzle / nose) is on the RIGHT, up is up.
Picture 2 is the FRONT view (looking back at the forward end), cropped exactly to the object: the object's left is on
the right of the picture. Both carry a grid in percent: 0 at the left / top edge, 100 at the right / bottom edge.

Split the object the way a 3D modeller would: into every piece that is its own shape (between 4 and {max_parts}
parts) - receiver, stock, grip, handguard, magazine, each sight, rails, barrel, muzzle device, trigger group, levers,
pods, canopy frame, hull sections, wheels, mirrors, bumpers. Small parts are built well; one big part is not. No
decals, no text, no screws smaller than 1% of the length.

Keep together what is ONE moulding or casting in reality: a polymer pistol frame WITH its grip and trigger guard,
a bullpup stock that is moulded with its receiver, a vehicle's one-piece body shell. A cut through the middle of
one moulding becomes a visible seam or gap when the halves are built apart. Everything that is bolted, clipped or
slid onto that moulding is its own part.

{method_rule}A typical rifle is 10-16 parts, a pistol 6-10, a truck 12-20 (body shell, hood, bed, doors if separate, each wheel,
bumpers, mirrors, lights), an aircraft 8-14 (hull, canopy, engines, pods, guns, skids or gear, tail).

 bare steel (bolt, pins, sight blades, a bare-metal receiver), a coloured panel, a lens. Each has its own tight
 side_box and front_span (percent, like a part) and material. A real weapon is never one material: polymer furniture,
 rubber grips and pads, blued or parkerised steel, anodised aluminium, glass optics. Give every such area a zone.
 A lens or an optic's glass that should be see-through is a separate code part with "glass": true, not a zone.)

 or plastic is metal false, even on a steel body: a painted truck panel is not metal.)
 "notes": "anything the assembly must respect"}}
Boxes of parts that touch MUST overlap by 1-2% where they join (a trigger guard into the frame, a grip into the
receiver): parts are modelled one at a time and a box that only meets its neighbour leaves a visible gap.
Together the boxes must cover the whole silhouette."""
