PROMPT = """You are reviewing a finished game asset. Judge what the delivered renders actually show.
Brief and requested changes: {brief}
Images in order: {images}
The original reference may NOT contain newly requested parts. Judge those against their written requirements.
When a SOURCE SEED preview is supplied, compare it with the finished model. If the source looks clean but the finish
has triangle/faceted patterns, report a finishing regression, not a need for a new mesh vendor. Lighting/view may differ.
The CANOPY-HIDDEN diagnostic image is a cutaway for inspecting internal geometry only. It is NOT how the asset ships.
Use it to distinguish hidden controls from broken/missing controls, never to claim the delivered glass is clear.
Fitting metadata below proves only that geometry was joined, NOT that it looks right: {assembly}
Judge silhouette, proportions, missing/fused/duplicate parts, colours, materials and texture quality.
For every requested assembly part check orientation, scale, floor contact, clearance and clipping against its
neighbours and the hull. In a cockpit: a readable seat facing the panel/nose, an accessible stick ahead of the seat,
pedals forward of it, a coherent floor/walls/bulkhead, no duplicate controls, floating floors, intersections or
blocked seat/leg space. A bounding box fit does not establish any of these. Inspect the focused renders.
If glass, hull or another part obscures a requirement, mark it unverified, not pass. Do not infer detail from logs.
Do not suggest darkening the glass to hide a requested interior. Repair assembly geometry/placement separately
from texture defects. An attractive exterior does not compensate for a broken requested cabin.

Use assembly_ok=null and assembly_checks=[] when no assembly is requested. If any requested part fails or is
unverified, assembly_ok=false and verdict=rebuild. A low-confidence or unreadable review is not acceptance.
