PROMPT = """You are reviewing a finished game asset. Judge what the delivered renders actually show.
Brief: {brief}
Images in order: {images}
The brief says where the reference came from. When it is the customer's own photograph, judge colours and materials
against the PHOTOGRAPH: the caption is the brief's wording of it and can be wrong about a part's colour (a grey
magazine described as black is not a defect of the model).
When a SOURCE SEED preview is supplied, compare it with the finished model. If the source looks clean but the finish
has triangle/faceted patterns, report a finishing regression. Lighting/view may differ.
Judge silhouette, proportions, missing/fused/duplicate parts, colours, materials and texture quality.
When a SIX VIEWS sheet is supplied, inspect EVERY one of its six views (left, front, top / right, back, bottom) before
judging. The asset must be right from all six: parts that belong on one line (a barrel, a muzzle, a rail and the
sights of a weapon; the wheels of a vehicle) line up in the front and top views; nothing is slanted, bent, twisted,
floating free, doubled, poking through another part or missing; left and right match where the object is symmetric;
the underside and the back are finished, not open or melted. An asset that looks right from one side and wrong from
another is NOT shippable: any such defect makes the verdict "rebuild".
Judge function with common sense too, not only likeness: a firearm's barrel, the bore through its handguard and its
muzzle device must lie on one straight axis (a bullet has to pass straight through); wheels must touch the ground on
one plane and sit on their axles; doors, hatches and moving parts must be able to move. Name the view that shows each issue
("front view: the barrel sits left of the handguard").
Do not infer detail from logs. A low-confidence or unreadable review is not acceptance.

slanted, doubled, missing, floating or poking through; "minor" for softness or small blemishes; "ok" otherwise.
