CODE_PROMPT = """You are modelling ONE part of a game-ready {category} in Blender, in Python, with a hard-surface kit.
The whole object: {description}
This part: {name} - {what}
Its box is L={L_mm:.1f} mm long (x), W={W_mm:.1f} mm wide (y), H={H_mm:.1f} mm tall (z).

Picture 1: the part's box from the SIDE (forward to the RIGHT, up is up), cropped exactly to the box and centred on a
square, with a scale in millimetres from the part's centre: read positions off it (x across, z up).
Picture 2: the same from the FRONT (the part's left on the right of the picture): y across, z up, millimetres.
Picture 3: the part in context with its neighbours, its box in blue.
Model what is inside the box at the level of detail the reference shows: the outline, the proportions and every
visible hole, slot, groove, recess, raised panel, step, facet and chamfer. A plain slab where the reference has
recesses and facets is wrong. Large parts carry most of the object's look: build them in layers (the main outline,
then raised panels and bosses, then recesses and cuts, then small features). Crisp hard-surface geometry, nothing
melted or blobby. A cutter must be one closed solid: for a rounded slot, kit.union a box and two end cylinders into
one cutter first.
Pick the kit call by the shape, not boxes for everything: a round part is kit.revolve (one outline gives every step,
groove and chamfer), a section that changes along the length is kit.loft, a moulded or rounded body is a bevel=0 cage
with kit.smooth or kit.fillet, a curved part is kit.bend, a rod or loop is kit.sweep.

Before the code, write a numbered list of every feature you can see in pictures 1 and 2: the outline, each opening,
recess, rib, groove, step, raised panel, screw or pin head, seam and chamfer, each with its position and size in mm
read off the scale. Then model every item on the list.

The kit:
{kit}

Write exactly one function and nothing else:
def build(kit, L, W, H):
    ...
    return [pieces]
Use only kit.*, math.* and the numbers L, W, H (metres). No imports. Answer with the code in one ```python block."""

REFINE_PROMPT = """The picture compares what your code built for {name} ({what}) with the reference. Top row: the SIDE,
bottom row: the FRONT. In each row the LEFT is the reference cropped to the part's box and the RIGHT is your build
rendered orthographically in the same box, same scale, same framing - so they should line up. In the FRONT
reference, parts in front of this one (a barrel, a muzzle device) can hide it; judge what is visible.
Be critical. First list, numbered, every feature the REFERENCE shows (the outline, each opening, recess, rib,
groove, step, raised panel, screw or pin head, seam, chamfer, rounded edge) and after each write FOUND or MISSING for
your build, and whether its position and size match. Then compare the outlines: where does yours stick out or fall
short, in mm?
Then the last line: VERDICT: OK only if nothing is MISSING and the outline matches within a few percent of the box.
A missing feature, a wrong outline, a part that does not fill its box like the reference does, or a plain slab where
the reference has recesses and facets is VERDICT: FIX - then give the corrected complete function, with every
MISSING feature added, in one ```python block after the verdict. Your previous code:
```python
{code}
```"""

CHECK_PROMPT = """You are checking an assembled game asset against its reference. Pictures 1 and 2: the reference side
and front views. Pictures 3 and 4: the assembly, same framing, same grid. Blue rectangles are the planned part boxes
(percent of the pictures), labelled by name.
The parts: {parts}
Find parts that are in the wrong place or the wrong size by more than 2% of the picture, parts whose shape is
clearly wrong, and GAPS: parts that should touch (a guard and the frame, a grip and the receiver) with background
showing between them - move the part so its box overlaps the neighbour's. Answer JSON only:
{{"ok": true/false, "moves": [{{"name": "...", "side_box": [x_left, x_right, z_top, z_bottom], "front_span": [y_left, y_right]}}],
  "rebuild": [{{"name": "...", "why": "what is wrong with its shape"}}], "notes": "..."}}
Coordinates in percent of the REFERENCE pictures, like the plan. Empty lists when nothing needs changing.
The LAST picture shows the assembly from ABOVE (the forward end at the top of the picture). Parts that sit on the
object's centreline (a barrel, a muzzle device, a rail, sights) must line up with the body along one straight line; a
part off to one side, or a body that runs at a slant to them, is wrong: move the part's front_span, or rebuild the
body when it is the slanted one.
Use common sense about how the object works, not only the pictures: a firearm's chamber, barrel, the bore through its
handguard and its muzzle device lie on ONE straight axis - a bullet has to pass straight through. A barrel that sits
off that axis, points at a slant or misses the handguard's opening is wrong even where the picture is unclear."""
