# Environment pieces (buildings, walls, bunkers, ruins, rocks, kit pieces)

One structure, plain white background, three-quarter view so the roof and two facades show. Name the
construction materials (sandbags, concrete, corrugated steel, stone, timber) and the footprint in
metres. A single building or ruin seeds well; a whole street does not - split it into pieces and build
each as its own asset.

Finishing: origin at the bottom centre on the ground plane, longest horizontal axis along +X, real
footprint in metres. Collision is a convex hull, which is coarse for hollow buildings - the customer
should use complex-as-simple collision in the engine if they need to walk inside. Realism check: stone
and concrete must be matte, windows should read as openings or glass, and the structure must sit flat.
