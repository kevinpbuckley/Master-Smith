# Weapons (rifles, pistols, launchers, melee)

The side profile carries almost all of a weapon's identity, so the reference picture is a clean product
shot: one weapon, full length from muzzle to stock, plain white background, no hands, no sling, no
background clutter, no perspective foreshortening. Name the real materials in the caption: anodised
aluminium, carbon fibre, blued steel, polymer, walnut. Say which parts are black and which are coloured.

Seed with detailed geometry and HD textures: standard geometry melts scopes, bipods and iron sights
into soft plastic. A second view down the barrel and a mirrored profile give the vendor the cross
section it cannot guess from one side. When the customer supplied a photo and the muzzle view was
approved, `hitem3d3mv` (Hi3D v3 multi-view) is the pick: the crispest hard-surface geometry, every
approved angle in its named slots, the same price as its single-picture sibling. The bullpup of
2026-09-25 built from one picture was clean; the finish, not the seed, needed the fixing.

Describe colours from the photo, part by part: a magazine or grip that shows the same grey as the body
IS grey, never "black steel" by habit. The reviewer holds the model to the caption. Part seeds (the
magazine and optic lists above) run only on hero budgets or when the brief asks, and only for a part the
reference actually shows: the picture editor will happily invent an optic for an empty rail.

Finishing: the long axis becomes +X (forward), origin at the centre of the body, real length in metres
(a rifle 1.0 to 1.3 m, a pistol 0.2 m, a rocket launcher 1.0 m). Collision is a convex hull; a weapon
never needs quads or a skeleton unless the customer asks for a rigged reload.

Realism check: the scope glass should read as glass, metal parts should have a low-to-mid roughness
with variation, and the silhouette must match the picture - a wrong silhouette means a new picture,
not a Blender repair.
