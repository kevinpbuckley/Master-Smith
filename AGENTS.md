# Master Smith - worked by a coding agent in this folder

Master Smith builds game-ready hard-surface 3D assets (weapons, vehicles, aircraft, props) as ASSEMBLIES of parts:
every part is drawn alone, meshed alone, registered to its picture and fitted into the box the plan gives it. Since
2026-09-28 the owner works it from here: the coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or another that reads this file) is
the director, planner and reviewer; the deterministic tools
in `python -m mastersmith.ms` do the drawing, meshing, registering and assembling. No server, no web page, no
container, no paid model API: the service, the chat app and the one-seed finish were deleted on 2026-09-28 (git
history before commit "Delete the service" has them).

Run everything from this folder with the venv: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m mastersmith.ms <command>`.
The step-by-step recipe is `.claude/skills/forge/SKILL.md` (Claude Code invokes it as `/forge`; Codex as `$forge`
through the `.agents/skills` link). Run `./scripts/setup-skills.ps1` once on Windows to create the link.
Keep shared skills in `.claude/skills`; both agents use the same files. Read the recipe before a build.
Agent-specific notes live in that agent's own file (`CLAUDE.md`, ...).

## Where things live

- `out/<Name>/` one job (folder name = asset name; `ms new` makes it):
  `brief.json` · `ref/` reference pictures · `plan/` side.png, front.png, `*_grid.png`, `dims.json`, `plan.json` ·
  `parts/<Part>/` side.png, quarter.png, seed.glb, registered.blend, registration.json, seed_render.png, fit.json ·
  `delivery/` SM_<Name>.glb + LODs, T_ maps, preview_*.png, `preview_views.png` (six sides), `preview.html`
  (written by `assemble`; `ms preview` opens it in the browser), report.json, zip.
- `mastersmith/skills/<category>.md` what a good asset of that category is (weapon, vehicle, aircraft, helicopter,
  prop, character, environment). Read the one for the job's category before planning.
- `mastersmith/blender/` the Blender scripts: `register_part.py` (turn the seed to match its picture),
  `assemble.py` (fit, tint, zones, glass, sharpen, bore alignment, bake, LODs, previews), `six_views.py`.
- `.env` holds FAL_KEY (git-ignored). NEVER print, echo, cat or grep the keys; never put them in a message.
- Local models: TRELLIS.2 (`trellis-cli.exe`, E:/local-models) meshes for free; FLUX.2 klein draws locally
  (`--model local`, weak). ComfyUI at E:/local-models/ComfyUI (Qwen-Image-Edit angles LoRA, unused so far).

## What costs money

- Nano Banana picture (`--model nano`, the default for `picture`, `view`, `part-pictures`): about $0.08 each,
  the three-quarter picture too. A 14-part gun is about 28 pictures = ~$2.30. `nano-pro` costs more; use it only
  for the hero reference picture.
- TRELLIS local mesh (`mesh --vendor local`): free, ~1 min per part on this PC. Tripo (`--vendor tripo`,
  tripo3d/h3.1) $0.60 per part (billed 2026-09-28; not $0.30). Hi3D v3 (`--vendor hitem3d3`) $2.10 per part - only when the owner asks for the paid mesher.
- Blender passes: free. Registration ~30 s, assembly 5-15 min, six views ~2 min.
Say the estimate before a step that spends, in one line; never spend on a step the owner did not ask for.

## The owner's rules (learned the hard way; do not relearn them)

1. LOOK at every picture and render with the Read tool before moving on. Nothing is "good" until you have seen
   `delivery/preview_views.png` from all six sides (top, bottom, front, back, left, right) and the previews.
2. Judge function by common sense, no reference needed: a bullet must be able to leave the gun (barrel, muzzle,
   sights and receiver on ONE axis, seen from the front and the top), wheels touch the ground, a canopy sits on the
   hull, nothing floats or pokes through. A muzzle is round, not oval.
3. Real materials: metal (barrel, muzzle device, bolt, rails) is dark reflective steel, grips and pads are rubber,
   optics have glass, furniture is polymer. One graphite-looking material everywhere is a fail. Colours come from
   the picture (`ms plan` samples them per part), not from guesses.
4. Edges are crisp: the assembler sharpens planar faces; a soft-plastic look means the part picture was soft or the
   seed was bad - redraw or re-mesh, do not accept it.
5. Hybrid since the evening of 2026-09-28 (the all-TRELLIS carbine came back "a mess": leaning sights, a rail that was
   an upper receiver, crumpled edges): SCULPTED parts (receiver, grip, handguard, a hull, a tyre) are meshed from their
   own pictures; MACHINED parts (rails, sights, trigger, charging handle, barrel, muzzle device, magazine, selector)
   are `"method": "code"` - built by `parts/<Part>/build.py` with the hard-surface kit (`ms build`), crisp by
   construction. Split the way a modeller would: barrel, muzzle device, each rail, each sight, magazine, grip, stock,
   handguard, each control, each wheel, each pod. Never lump (four tyres together came back as one black blob).
6. The part pictures are kept in `parts/<Part>/` so the same parts can be meshed again with a better model later.
   Never delete them. They, `ref/ref_*.png` and `parts/<Part>/build.py` are the asset's SOURCE: before drawing
   anything, check what exists (`ms status`) and ask the owner whether to use it; the picture tools refuse to draw
   over an existing picture and only `--redraw`, after a yes, draws again (2026-09-28: a job is routinely cleared
   down to its pictures and rebuilt for free).
7. Sizes are read off the gridded picture as percent boxes; touching parts overlap 1-2 %; boxes cover the whole
   silhouette. Thin free-standing parts (barrel, muzzle) get their height measured off the silhouette by `ms plan`.
8. The biggest part keeps the depth the mesher gave it (`keep_depth`); every other part fills its box on all three
   axes (`fill_box`). Parts on the bore axis (barrel, muzzle, suppressor, sights) are `centreline` parts and get
   moved onto the body's bore by the assembler.
9. Registration: a seed from a three-quarter picture is yaw-swept, pitch-swept, and, when long, sheared out of its
   perspective. Check `parts/<Part>/seed_render.png` against `side.png`; if it sits wrong, `ms register <job>
   <Part> --yaw <deg> --pitch <deg>` (yaw about the vertical, pitch in the side plane, degrees) and look again.
10. Commit only when `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests -q` passes. Commit messages end with
    the agent's own co-author line (see its file). `dev` is the working branch (owner, 2026-09-28): commit and
    push there directly. `master` is what people run; it changes only by a PR from `dev` that the owner merges.

## The plan JSON (written by you, validated by `ms plan`)

Percent boxes are read off `plan/side_grid.png` (0 = left/top edge, 100 = right/bottom edge; forward end on the
RIGHT) and `plan/front_grid.png` when there is one (looking back at the forward end, the object's left on the right
of the picture). Without a front picture, `front_span` is your estimate of the part's width as percent of the
object's full width, centred parts symmetric about 50.

```json
{"parts": [
  {"name": "Barrel", "what": "one sentence: shape, features, colour and finish, as seen alone in the picture",
   "method": "vendor",
   "side_box": [x_left, x_right, z_top, z_bottom],
   "front_span": [y_left, y_right],
   "material": {"color": "#rrggbb", "finish": "metal|polymer|rubber|painted|glass|wood|fabric",
                "metal": true, "roughness": 0.35, "glass": false, "keep_texture": false},
   "zones": [{"name": "Pad", "side_box": [...], "front_span": [...], "material": {...}}]}
 ],
 "notes": "anything the assembly must respect"}
```
`zones` are areas of a part in a different material (rubber pad on a polymer stock, glass lens on a scope). `metal`
is true only for bare metal. A dark metal is lifted to 7% reflectance by adding grey (`mastersmith/blender/colour.py`), but a tinted colour
still renders more saturated on large flat faces: give blued or black steel a near-neutral colour (the shotgun's #283446 came out navy,
2026-09-29). `"reference_detail": false` on a code part skips projecting the reference picture's
surface detail onto it (for a part whose coded shape is not the drawn one: folding sights, 2026-09-28). `"skin": true` on a code part dresses its exact coded shape in the texture of its own diffused mesh (draw its pictures and `ms mesh` it; the assembler bakes that mesh's colour onto the code part and tints it to the plan): code parts no longer read as flat CG beside the diffused ones (owner, 2026-09-29; an all-diffused M4A1 lost its barrel and its magazine came back a see-through shell, so machined parts stay code). Every code part's edges get a small round (0.08% of the asset's length, `"edge_break": false` keeps them razor sharp, `assemble --no-edge-break` for all). `"interior": true` marks a cockpit or cabin: `ms cabin` measures the body's well and gives it the box that fits, its pictures are drawn as an insert of that size, and the assembler reports how much of it pokes into the body. `"color_lock": true` always tints a vendor part to its planned colour. A rifle is 10-16 parts, a pistol 6-10, a truck 12-20, an aircraft 8-14.

## Commands (`python -m mastersmith.ms ...`)

| command | does |
|---|---|
| `new <Name> --category weapon --size 0.68 --description "..."` | makes `out/<Name>/` with brief.json |
| `picture <job> --out ref/ref_0.png --prompt "..." [--ref file] [--model nano\|nano-pro\|local]` | draws a picture |
| `view <job> --which side\|front\|back\|top\|quarter --from ref/ref_0.png [--mirror] [--fixes "..."]` | one standard view of the same object |
| `grid <job> --side ref/ref_side.png [--front ref/ref_front.png] [--mirror]` | crops to the silhouette, draws the percent grids, writes dims.json |
| `plan <job> plan.json` | validates your plan, snaps thin parts, samples colours, writes plan/plan.json |
| `part-pictures <job> <Part> [--fixes "..."] [--no-quarter] [--no-front] [--with-front] [--no-side]` | side picture of that part alone + its three-quarter picture. A side picture drawn facing the wrong way is turned round (kept in `unused/`). Only the body's three-quarter picture gets the whole-object front view (it made 8 of 13 parts come back as the whole rifle; `--with-front` for another part). An `interior` part is drawn as the insert that fills its box, with `fit_card.png` |
| `build <job> <Part>` | a `"method": "code"` part: runs `parts/<Part>/build.py` (`def build(kit, L, W, H)`, kit in `mastersmith/blender/hskit.py`) -> `<Part>.blend` + side/front/iso renders |
| `mesh <job> <Part> [--vendor local\|tripo\|hitem3d3] [--from quarter\|side]` | meshes the part and registers it |
| `register <job> <Part> [--yaw deg] [--pitch deg] [--from side]` | registers again, with your correction |
| `fit <job> <Part> [--quarter] [--free]` | bends the registered seed through a coarse lattice until its outline lies on its side picture (and three-quarter picture), reports the overlap before/after and how far the surface turned; a fit that would crumple the surface or gains nothing is refused and the mesh left as it was (`--free`: the old per-vertex fit, which crumpled a Tripo fuselage by 1 m); `registered_unfitted.blend` is the undo |
| `cabin <job> <Part> [--hull <Part>]` | measures the body's open cockpit well (floor, walls, sill) with rays on its registered seed placed as the assembler places it, prints the interior's box that fits (mm and plan percents) and draws `parts/<Part>/fit_card.png` |
| `brush <job> <Part> --op inflate\|move\|smooth\|flatten\|crease --at front+0,0,-0.01 --radius 10 --strength 2` | one headless brush stroke (mm; anchors front/back/top/bottom/left/right/centre); logged in `brush_log.json`, `--replay` after a re-mesh |
| `sdf <job> <Part> [sdf.py]` | an exact part from `parts/<Part>/sdf.py` (`def part(kit, L, W, H)`, the kit in `mastersmith/sdfkit.py`): marching cubes in the part's box, imported as `registered.blend` with the planned material |
| `assemble <job> [--parts A,B] [--no-sharpen]` | fits, tints, bakes, LODs, previews, six views |
| `sheet <file.glb>` | six views of any GLB |
| `refs [<job> ...] [--no-open]` | serves the reference pictures of the listed jobs (all jobs when none) on one local page with Approve / Redraw and a note per picture; the owner's choices land in `ref/review.json` (`ms status` prints them). Drafts moved to `ref/unused/` are not shown; `ref/notes.txt` is shown above a job's pictures |
| `results [<job> ...] [--no-open]` | every delivered job (or the listed ones) on one local page: six views, score and defects from `delivery/scorecard.json` (`{"score", "spent", "tonetta", "defects"}`, written by the agent after its review), cost, links to each job's 3D preview, GLB and zip, all from one port |
| `preview <job> [--no-open]` | serves `delivery/preview.html` (3D viewer, six views, every part's pictures beside its seed) and opens it |
| `package <job>` | README, manifest, zip in delivery/ |
| `status <job>` | what the job has so far |

`<job>` is `out/<Name>`. Every command prints where it wrote; Read those files.

## Materials

Two passes in `assemble` make the surfaces (both on by default; `--no-projection`, `--no-materials` to compare):
- **Picture projection** (#14): each part's own side picture (mirrored for the far side) and the approved front
  view are projected as base colour where the faces look at them, luminance-flattened so the picture's lighting
  does not print; the mesher's texture stays where no picture sees.
- **Smart materials** (#15): a CC0 surface set per finish (`mastersmith/materials.py`, fetched once from ambientCG
  into `E:/local-models/pbr/`): brushed or parkerised steel, anodised aluminium, black polymer, rubber, powder-coat
  paint - light/dark variation over the planned colour, real roughness structure, a fine bump, and ambient-occlusion
  dirt in cavities and at joins. The per-finish rules the plan should follow are in `mastersmith/skills/materials.md`.

## Sculpting without a mouse

Three tools stand in for an artist's hands; use them after looking, never blind.
- **`fit`** when a seed's outline is off its picture (a fat magazine, a tapered handguard drawn straight): the
  picture is the target. Check `seed_render.png` after; run `assemble` to see it in place.
- **`brush`** for a local fix you can name: "the grip's heel swells 3 mm too far" -> `--op inflate --at back+0,0,-0.03
  --radius 12 --strength -3`; a soft panel -> `--op flatten`; a rounded edge that should be crisp -> `--op crease --at
  ... --to ...`. Coordinates are metres in the part's frame (centred, X forward, Z up); `--radius`/`--strength` in mm.
- **`sdf`** for parts that ARE geometry: barrel, muzzle device, rails, sights, pins, knobs, magazine bodies. Write
  `parts/<Part>/sdf.py`:
  ```python
  def part(kit, L, W, H):                        # the part's box, metres, centred at the origin, X forward
      tube = kit.cylinder(W / 2, L, axis="x")
      bore = kit.cylinder(kit.mm(5.56) / 2, L * 1.1, axis="x")
      return tube - bore
  ```
  Idioms: a Picatinny rail = `box` minus `box(slot).repeat([mm(10), 0, 0], [n, 1, 1])`; a muzzle brake = `cylinder`
  minus `cylinder(port, axis="y").repeat(...)` minus the bore; a moulded join = `smooth_union(a, b, mm(2))`; a
  rounded body = `rounded_box`; a tapered stock comb = `wedge`; symmetric features = `.mirror("y")`. Sizes come
  from the plan's box (L, W, H) and the mm you can read off the picture. Then `assemble`.

## Testing and code changes

`.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests -q` (about 10 s; the tests pin the LLM/no-spend env). Blender scripts
cannot be unit-tested; run them on a real part and look. When a Blender pass fails, its log is
`out/<Name>/<tag>.log`. Keep the code style: one-line docstrings that say why, dated notes for lessons learned.
