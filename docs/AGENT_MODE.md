# Another brain: Claude Code, Codex or any MCP client as the director

The web chat's director is an OpenRouter model. For testing, or just to use a subscription you already pay for, the
director's *thinking* can run in Claude Code, Codex or any MCP client instead, with the same system prompt, skills,
tools and remedies. Pictures, meshes, masks, the Blender finish and the vision checks still run in the API on your
fal.ai and OpenRouter keys; only the director's own tokens move. OpenRouter stays available in the web at any time.

Every chat driven this way is recorded on the API (`record_turn`), so it appears in the web's sidebar with its jobs,
pictures and downloads like any other, and can be continued there or here.

## How it fits

```
Claude Code / Codex  --MCP (stdio)-->  python -m mastersmith mcp  --HTTP-->  the API (:8080)
                                       (one tool per director tool)         session state, jobs, chats
```

`python -m mastersmith mcp` exposes: `director_prompt`, `set_brief`, `make_reference`, `build`, `import_model`,
`job_status`, `read_skill`, `ask_customer`, `balance`, `upload_picture`, `record_turn`. Each call runs the same
director method the web chat uses, in a session named by `MASTERSMITH_SESSION` (default `director`).

Under the hood the API offers `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/prompt`, `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/tool {name, args}` and
`POST /v1/sessions/{id}/turn {user, reply}`; any client that can speak HTTP can be the director the same way.

## Claude Code

The repo ships `.mcp.json` (the server) and the `/director` skill. From the repo folder, with the API running:

```
claude                      # in E:\Master-Smith; approve the master-smith MCP server when asked
/director                   # then talk: "a weathered oak ammunition crate, 1 m, Unreal"
```

The skill tells Claude to read `director_prompt` first, act only through the tools, show reference pictures for
approval before building, and record every turn. Set `MASTERSMITH_API_KEY` in `.mcp.json`'s `env` if the API has one.

Headless, for scripts and tests:

```
claude -p "a wooden barrel, 1 m, Unreal; set the brief and draw the reference" --mcp-config .mcp.json \
       --allowedTools "mcp__master-smith__*" --append-system-prompt-file .claude/skills/director/SKILL.md
```

## Codex

```
codex mcp add master-smith -- python -m mastersmith mcp
```

with `MASTERSMITH_API_URL` (and `MASTERSMITH_API_KEY`, `MASTERSMITH_SESSION`) in the environment Codex starts from.
Then tell Codex: "Call director_prompt and act as the Master Smith director. I want a wooden barrel, 1 m, Unreal."

## What still costs money

| Where | What | Paid by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The client (Claude Code, Codex) | the director's reasoning and tool calls | your subscription |
| The API | reference pictures, extra angles, cockpit/part pictures | OpenRouter image models |
| The API | picture checks, facing, review | OpenRouter vision model |
| The API | meshes, masks, rigs, repaint | fal.ai |

Building from Claude Code is exactly as expensive on fal and OpenRouter *images* as building from the web; what you
save is the director's chat, which is cents a turn with Gemini Flash and dollars an hour with Opus.
