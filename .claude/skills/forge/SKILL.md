description: Build a game-ready hard-surface asset (weapon, vehicle, aircraft, prop) as an assembly of parts with the ms tools - reference pictures, gridded plan, per-part pictures, TRELLIS meshes, registration, assembly, six-view review, package. Use when the owner asks to build, rebuild, fix or re-mesh a model.

# Build an asset with `ms`

`PY=.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m mastersmith.ms`. Everything below is run from the repo root. Read AGENTS.md's rules
first; read `mastersmith/skills/<category>.md` for the category. Say the cost of a step before spending.

## 0. Pictures that already exist are used, never redrawn without asking
Before ANY step that draws (2, 4, and `--fixes` redraws): `$PY status out/<Name>` (or `ls out/<Name>/ref
out/<Name>/parts/*/`) and look at what is there. `ref/ref_*.png`, `parts/<Part>/side.png`, `parts/<Part>/quarter.png`
and `parts/<Part>/build.py` are the asset's source, kept on purpose (a job cleared down to them is normal: meshes,
registrations and deliveries are rebuilt for free). When they exist, show the owner the list and ASK whether to use
them or draw again; use them unless told otherwise. The tools refuse to draw over an existing picture (`kept: ...
already exists`); `--redraw` is passed only after the owner said to draw again. `ms new` on an existing job keeps its
pictures and brief (`--rebrief` rewrites the brief).

## 1. Brief
`$PY new <Name> --category weapon|vehicle|aircraft|helicopter|prop --size <longest side, m> --description "..."`
Sizes: a rifle 0.65-1.0 m, a pistol 0.2 m, a truck 5-6 m, a gunship 12-18 m. `--tris 100000` for a hero asset.

## 2. Reference pictures (approve them with the owner before meshing anything)
- A hero picture: `$PY picture out/<Name> --out ref/ref_0.png --prompt "..."` (`--ref` a photo when the owner gave
  one; `--model nano-pro` for the hero). Describe the design fully: era, materials, colours, every feature.
- Standard views from it: `$PY view out/<Name> --which side --from ref/ref_0.png` (forward end must point RIGHT;
  `--mirror` if it came out the other way) and `--which front`. Vehicles/aircraft also `--which back`, `--which top`.
- Read each picture. Redraw with `--fixes "..."` when the design drifted; move a draft you replaced into `ref/unused/`
  (never delete it). Write one line per job in `ref/notes.txt` (what to look at), then `$PY refs out/<Name> [more jobs]`
  serves every picture with Approve / Redraw on one local page: give the owner the URL and WAIT for approval unless
  told to skip it. Their choices are in `ref/review.json` (`$PY status out/<Name>`); a Redraw's note is the `--fixes`.

## 3. Grid and plan
- `$PY grid out/<Name> --side ref/ref_side.png --front ref/ref_front.png` -> `plan/side_grid.png`,
  `plan/front_grid.png`, dims. Read both grids.
- Write `out/<Name>/plan/plan_draft.json` (shape in AGENTS.md): split the object the way a modeller would, one
  part per shape, percent boxes read off the grids, touching boxes overlapping 1-2 %, boxes covering the whole
  silhouette, real materials per part, zones for pads/lenses/bare metal. Every part `"method": "vendor"`.
- `$PY plan out/<Name> plan/plan_draft.json` -> prints the parts with their mm sizes, snapped heights and sampled
  colours. Check the sizes make sense (a barrel 13-25 mm across, a magazine 25-35 mm wide, a wheel round).

## 4. Part pictures (about $0.16 per part; vendor parts only)
For each part: `$PY part-pictures out/<Name> <Part>` -> `parts/<Part>/side.png` and `quarter.png`. The biggest
part's side picture is the approved side view with the other parts ERASED (nothing drawn); every other part is drawn
alone from the approved view. Read both pictures per part: the part must be whole, alone, same design and colours,
on white. Redraw with `--fixes "..."` when not.

## 4b. Code parts (free, seconds each)
Machined parts are `"method": "code"` in the plan. Write `out/<Name>/parts/<Part>/build.py` with
`def build(kit, L, W, H)` (part-local frame: +X forward, +Y left, +Z up, metres, centred on the box; the kit's calls
are in `mastersmith/blender/hskit.py`: box, cylinder, tube, profile, revolve, cut, union, hole, slot, array, rotate,
fillet). `$PY build out/<Name> <Part>` -> `parts/<Part>/<Part>.blend` and `<Part>_side/front/iso.png`. Read the
renders next to `side.png`; edit and build again until the shape and the orientation are right. No pictures needed
for a code part, but `part-pictures` for it is still worth the $0.16 when the shape is not obvious from the plan.
When the part picture and common sense disagree (a barrel drawn thick at the muzzle, an AR T-handle for a bullpup's
side slot, eleven fine teeth on a 68 mm rail), common sense and the reference picture win; say so in the review.
A code part's box is its TIGHT silhouette read off the grid: the assembler stretches a build to fill its box on
every axis (up to 2x), so a 41 mm box around a 13 mm trigger blade turned it into a wedge (2026-09-28). A vendor
seed with a hollow the picture invented (the Tripo receiver's open bolt trough) is filled by the code part that sits
on it: deepen that part's box and give the builder a keel (the bullpup's TopRail).

## 5a. Part review gate: every part passes before anything is assembled
Nothing goes to `assemble` until every part has been judged AGAINST ITS PICTURE, not as a shape alone (2026-09-28:
a magazine built as a straight box went unnoticed until the owner asked for the comparison). For each part, Read
its `side.png` (and `quarter.png`) beside its render (`<Part>_side.png` and `<Part>_iso.png` for a code part,
`seed_render.png` for a meshed one) and give the owner one table: part, pass/fail, what differs. Fail means fix at
that part's step (edit build.py, re-register, redraw and re-mesh) and review again. A meshed seed often carries
a feature the plan also codes (the Tripo handguard came with its own side rail, the receiver with a charging
handle): when the seed already has it, DROP the code part from the plan rather than fit both (a duplicate rail
stood 6 mm off the handguard, owner 2026-09-29). Tell the owner the table, with
the failures and their fixes, before step 6.

## 5. Mesh and register (free with TRELLIS)
`$PY mesh out/<Name> <Part>` for each part -> `seed.glb`, then registered to its side picture -> `registered.blend`,
`seed_render.png`, IoU printed. Read `seed_render.png` beside `side.png` and `quarter.png`: same object, same
orientation, forward end right, upright, nothing missing. If not: `$PY register out/<Name> <Part> --yaw 180` (or `--pitch -30`, degrees; `--from side` to skip the
sweeps) and look again. IoU under 0.5 usually means the quarter picture was a different object: redraw it.
Meshing with `--vendor hitem3d3` ($2.10) only when the owner asks; the kept pictures make that a one-liner later.

## 6. Assemble and review
`$PY assemble out/<Name>` (5-15 min) -> `delivery/SM_<Name>.glb`, previews, `preview_views.png`, `preview.html`.
`$PY preview out/<Name>` serves the page and opens it for the owner: a 3D viewer of the GLB, the six views, the
previews, the reference pictures and every part's pictures beside its registered seed. Give the owner that URL.
The page is served by the `preview` command and dies with it: after EVERY assemble that is reported to the owner
(the first one and every re-assemble after a fix), run `$PY preview out/<Name>` again (in the background) and put
the fresh URL in the message. A delivery message without a live preview link is incomplete (owner, 2026-09-29).
Read `preview_views.png` and every `preview_*.png` yourself. Check, in this order, and fix before anything else:
1. Function (common sense): barrel, muzzle, sights and receiver on one axis from the FRONT and the TOP; the bore
   is at the muzzle's centre; wheels on the ground; nothing floating, nothing poking through, no gaps at joins.
2. Proportions against the side picture: each part in its box, the magazine not fat, the barrel not thin.
3. Materials: steel is dark and reflective, rubber matt, glass glassy, polymer satin; colours match the picture.
4. Edges crisp, muzzle round, no blobs.
5. Surfaces opaque and one colour per material: a slot or panel line showing on BOTH sides, the picture's
   white background as pale patches on a magazine or grip, or a see-through look means the picture projection
   (#14) misfired on that job; `assemble --no-projection` keeps the smart materials and drops it (the bullpup,
   2026-09-29: its body picture carries the grip, and the far side gets the picture mirrored).
A wrong outline is fixed on the mesh: `$PY fit out/<Name> <Part>` sculpts the seed onto its side picture; a
local fault you can name, `$PY brush out/<Name> <Part> --op ...`; a part that is pure geometry (barrel, muzzle
device, rail, sight), `$PY sdf out/<Name> <Part>` from a `sdf.py` you write (AGENTS.md, "Sculpting without a
mouse"). Otherwise a wrong part is fixed at its own step: re-register (5), redraw and re-mesh (4-5), or a better box (3, then `plan`
and `assemble` again); `--parts A,B` assembles a subset while checking. Score it /10 for the owner, with the
defects named by view. Do not call it good under 7 without saying why.

## 7. Package
`$PY package out/<Name>` -> `delivery/<Name>.zip` with README and manifest. Tell the owner the path.
The delivery message always carries, in this order: the preview URL (from a `preview` run started after the last
assemble), the GLB path, the zip path, the score /10 with the defects by view, and what was spent.

A batch of builds: after each asset's review write `delivery/scorecard.json` (`{"score": 8, "spent": "$0.92", "defects": [...]}`),
then `$PY results out/A out/B ...` serves all of them on one page with links to every preview; give the owner that URL.

## Re-meshing kept parts later
The pictures in `parts/<Part>/` are the asset's source. `$PY mesh out/<Name> <Part> --vendor hitem3d3` (or a new
local model once wired into `mastersmith/local.py`) then `$PY assemble out/<Name>` rebuilds with the new mesh.
